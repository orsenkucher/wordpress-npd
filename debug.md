You're absolutely right, and I apologize for the confusion in my previous response. Your observation is correct and very important. Let's rectify this and approach the problem more accurately:

1. WordPress Container Configuration:
The WordPress container should indeed keep its default path of `/var/www/html`. Changing this could cause issues with the WordPress installation and its plugins.

2. Nginx Configuration:
The Nginx container needs to be configured to look for files in the correct location that matches where PHP-FPM (WordPress container) is serving them from.

Here's how we should approach this:

1. Keep the WordPress Docker Compose file (`~/apps/wordpress-iris-hep/wordpress-npd/docker-compose.yaml`) as it is:

```yaml
version: '3'
services:
  npd-wordpress-db:
    # ... (keep this section as is)

  npd-wordpress:
    depends_on:
      - npd-wordpress-db
    image: wordpress:php8.3-fpm
    container_name: npd-wordpress
    restart: unless-stopped
    env_file: .env
    environment:
      - WORDPRESS_DB_HOST=npd-wordpress-db:3306
      - WORDPRESS_DB_USER=$MYSQL_USER
      - WORDPRESS_DB_PASSWORD=$MYSQL_PASSWORD
      - WORDPRESS_DB_NAME=wordpress
    volumes:
      - ./wordpress:/var/www/html  # Keep this as is
      - ./uploads.ini:/usr/local/etc/php/conf.d/uploads.ini
      - ./php.ini:/usr/local/etc/php/conf.d/php.override.ini
    networks:
      - smokemilk

networks:
  smokemilk:
    external: true

```

2. Update the Nginx configuration to point to the correct location. Create or modify the Nginx configuration file (e.g., `/etc/nginx/conf.d/wordpress.conf` in the Nginx container) with the following content:

```nginx
server {
    listen 443 ssl;
    server_name iris-hep.syntech.systems;
    
    # SSL configuration (keep your existing SSL settings)

    root /var/www/iris-hep/html;
    index index.php;

    location / {
        try_files $uri $uri/ /index.php?$args;
    }

    location ~ \.php$ {
        try_files $uri =404;
        fastcgi_split_path_info ^(.+\.php)(/.+)$;
        fastcgi_pass npd-wordpress:9000;
        fastcgi_index index.php;
        include fastcgi_params;
        fastcgi_param SCRIPT_FILENAME /var/www/html$fastcgi_script_name;
        fastcgi_param PATH_INFO $fastcgi_path_info;
    }

    # Other necessary configurations...
}

```

The key change here is in the `fastcgi_param SCRIPT_FILENAME` line. We're telling Nginx to pass the request to PHP-FPM using the path `/var/www/html`, which is the correct path inside the WordPress container.

3. In the Nginx Docker Compose file (`~/nginx-test/docker-compose.yml`), ensure the volume mounting is correct:

```yaml
version: '3'
services:
  nginx:
    image: nginx:1.15-alpine
    restart: unless-stopped
    volumes:
      - ./data/nginx:/etc/nginx/conf.d
      - ./data/certbot/conf:/etc/letsencrypt
      - ./data/certbot/www:/var/www/certbot
      - ./data/nginx/wellknown:/var/www/wellknown
      - /home/smokemilk/apps/wordpress-choice/wordpress:/var/www/html
      - /home/smokemilk/apps/wordpress-iris-hep/wordpress-npd/wordpress:/var/www/iris-hep/html
    # ... rest of the configuration

```

This setup maintains the correct path for the WordPress files in both containers while allowing Nginx to serve them properly.

After making these changes:

1. Rebuild and restart your containers:
   ```bash
   docker compose down
   docker compose up -d --build
   ```

2. Verify the setup:
   ```bash
   docker compose exec npd-wordpress php -r "echo file_exists('/var/www/html/index.php') ? 'File exists' : 'File not found';"
   docker compose exec nginx ls -l /var/www/iris-hep/html
   ```

These changes should resolve the path mismatch while maintaining the correct file structure for both Nginx and WordPress containers. If you still encounter issues, please provide the output of the verification commands and any error messages you see in the Nginx or PHP-FPM logs.
